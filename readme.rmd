Might need to change file paths slightly, and also might need to debug to make sure alignment is good. 

It worked for me until my 24 sec run and then I did some slight changes and broke it (I think it's mostly an alignment issue)

I think they took my record down :( (see screenshot)

Motivation: I got addicted to this website and there was no way I would beat the wr manually, so I made a bot to do it.
